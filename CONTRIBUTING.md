# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Please follow the guidelines below to ensure consistency and maintain high-quality collaboration across the team.

## 🚀 Branch Naming Convention

When creating a branch, use the following format based on the type of change:

- **Features**: `feat/feature-name`
- **Fixes**: `fix/fix-description`

All branch names must:
- Be **lowercase**
- Use **hyphens (-)** to separate words

**Examples:**
- `feat/add-login-authentication`
- `fix/handle-empty-user-input`

---

## ✅ Commit Message Style

Commit messages should follow the branch type and use the same naming style:

- Start with the branch type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`)
- Use lowercase and hyphens to describe the change
- Keep messages short but descriptive

**Examples:**
- `feat/add-user-profile-page`
- `fix/correct-missing-token-error`

---

## 🔁 Pull Request (PR) Workflow

### ✅ Required Steps:
1. **Create a PR** from your feature/fix branch **into `dev`**
2. Do **not** commit or push directly to `dev`
3. **Do not** merge your own PR — wait for a review and approval from a maintainer or assigned reviewer
4. Ensure your PR clearly describes:
   - What was changed
   - Why it was changed
   - Any related issue or ticket numbers

---

## 🔒 Restrictions

- ❌ No direct commits or pushes to `dev`
- ❌ Do not merge PRs without at least one approval
- ❌ Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single PR

---

By following these rules, we keep our workflow clean, maintainable, and collaborative. Thank you!
